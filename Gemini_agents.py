Analyze the user's request and answer this question:

Respond with **only one word**: `yes` or `no`. 

Use the following rules:
â€¢ Respond `yes` if the user clearly mentions a meme *template*, *format*, or *type of meme* (e.g., 'Distracted Boyfriend', 'Drakeposting', 'Two Buttons').
â€¢ Respond `no` if the user only refers to *text*, *message*, *topic* without mentioning templates or if the request is unclear, ambiguous.
â€¢ If uncertain, make your best guess based on the language of the request.
